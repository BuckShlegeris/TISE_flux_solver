TISE flux solver

Buck Shlegeris, 2013, bshlegeris@gmail.com

This is software which solves the time-independent Schroedinger equation to 
determine the particle flux through some piecewise constant potential function.

For example, the software can calculate the transmission amplitude for a particle
of whatever energy through a finite barrier or finite well.

The code which does that solving is in flux_solver.py.

The response_curves.py module just contains a function to call the functions in 
flux_solver.py with different energy values. This allows you to see the
transmission probabilites for a potential function as a function of the energy
of an incoming particle. This is basically a response curve. If you just run the
module as a script, an example will run.

repeated_barriers.py is an example of using this code.

DEPENDENCIES

The code requires Numpy and Pylab.
