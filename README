Particle Flux Solver

Buck Shlegeris, 2013, bshlegeris@gmail.com

This is software which solves the time-independant Schroedinger equation to 
determine the particle flux through some piecewise constant potential function.

For example, the software can calculate the transmission amplitude for a particle
of whatever energy through a finite barrier or finite well.

The code which does that solving is in fluxsolver.py.

The responsecurves.py module just contains a function to call the functions in 
fluxsolver.py with different energy values. This allows you to see the
transmission probabilites for a potential function as a function of the energy
of an incoming particle. This is basically a response curve. If you just run the
module as a script, an example will run.

DEPENDENCIES

The code requires Numpy and Pylab.
